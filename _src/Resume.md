## Skills

**Languages**  
I’ve written a lot of different types of applications on the JVM platform using various languages (Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, and Java 5.0+). 
I’m familiar not only with the languages, but also the JRE itself and their compilers.

I’ve written both scripts and web applications in Python, Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript.  
My Python and Perl skills are a mix of system operations tools and web development. 
My JavaScript skills lean more toward the browser than Node.js.

I have a deep love for LISPs and ML languages. 
I write a lot of OCaml and Clojure in my free time.

I have a huge passion programming languages. 
Design, compilers, syntax - I can never get enough. 
I’d be excited to chat with you about any language you don’t see explicitly listed here.

**Leadership**  
I’ve done everything from 2 to 11-man teams, from bug tracking to coaching and HR. 
I have a passion for sharing my knowledge with new developers, and I've been told I am an inspirational teacher. 
I pride myself in creating collaborative rather than competitive environments for software developers to thrive in.

**Systems design**  
I’ve been in the unique position to design about 70% of the systems I’ve built. 
I bring a lot of experience to the table when designing a system from the ground up. 
The other 30% of the time, I bring the ability to work on one piece of the system while keeping the whole stack in mind while 
I make decisions and write code.

**System operations**  
I often find myself serving dual-duty as a developer and a system operator. 
I have extensive experience with various Linux operating systems. 
From continuous integration to python scripts that should be written in bash, 
my operating system and I have had a long and fruitful relationship.

Code is a liability, features are an asset.
