# Hello, world! 

Static content generators have been sort of a fad lately. I've used them in the past to generate all sorts of 
documentation and marketing pages for various jobs. In those days, I'd always use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or 
more recently, [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/). Jekyll always had a huge community behind it which made finding 
themes or plugins a breeze, and let's face it if you're using a static content generator you're not looking to spend 
a lot of time on it. Cryogen was chosen because the ecosystem already had a large number of clojure web projects in it already, 
so using lein and the JRE was a big win.

This time, I've decided to go with [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog) because I really love lisp and I don't get to 
interact with the racket community very often. I seriously considered [Stog](http://zoggy.github.io/stog/) because of my equal love 
of OCaml, but I just can't stand XML.

So here it is, my blog. Hopefully you'll find it usefull.
